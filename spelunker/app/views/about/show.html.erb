<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p class="lead">The V&amp;A Spelunker is a rough thing built by <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com" title="design in service to cultural heritage">Good, Form &amp; Spectacle</a> to give a different view into the collection of the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a>. Hearty thanks go to <a href="http://tomarmitage.com">Tom Armitage</a> for doing most of the tech-y building bits.</p>

<p>The <strong><%= link_to 'Date Graph', completeness_path %></strong> is a visualization of just three fields in the collection database: <code>year_start</code>, <code>year_end</code> and <code>museum_number</code> (which we've hacked a teeny bit to try to extract an year each object was acquired). On the left side of the visualization, you can see <strong style="color:yellow; background-color:black;">yellow</strong> bars that show the <code>year_start</code> and <code>year_end</code> dates assigned to each object in the database to indicate the circa date (or in some cases the specific date) when that object was created. The yellow bars are given a "completeness" score too, which simple shows a simple scale of how many fields in that record are complete, or not. The brighter the row, the more complete the record. On the right side of the visualization you can see a graph of when each object was acquired by the museum mapped by a whole bunch of <strong style="color:cyan;background-color:black;">blue</strong> notches. If you see a red notch in that column, that means we weren't able to surface a date from the acquisition column that looked like a year. You can also use the form up the top to constrain the graph to show objects between specific years. <a href="/completeness?start=2000&end=2014">2000-2014</a> is a fun range, for example.</p>
<p>The <strong><%= link_to 'Big Dumb List', list_things_path %></strong> is just that. The very first step in understanding any big database, just showing everything, and making simple ways to navigate around in it so you can quickly get a feel for scale, and interconnection.</p>
<p>The <strong><%= link_to 'Browse by Facets', facets_path %></strong> is also just what it says on the tin. The collections database has a few fields that are approachable to normal humans, like <a href="/facets/materials">material</a>, <a href="/facets/location">location in the museum</a>, or <a href="/facets/place">place in the world</a>. We've just made these things filters for the Big Dumb List so you can see stuff like about <a href="/facets/location">400,000 objects are currently in storage</a>, or <a href="/facets/place/California">157 things from California</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/api/">V&A API</a> has been online for some years now. It's robust and well-documented. Go play with it!</p>
