Exploring the Victoria & Albert Museum Catalogue
=======

This is a collaboration with Tom Armitage; we're working on general catalogue spelunking and exploration. 

With thanks to Luca, Andrew, Julian and James at V&A Digital for the giant blob of data.

We launched the project on January 6, 2015.
